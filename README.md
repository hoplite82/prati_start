# Personal Site Robert Pratersch

## Purpose

- Source for [www.pratersch.de](http://pratersch.de)  
- Skills
- Portfolio as Freelancer
- my story
- link to blog
- first contact to customer

## Documantation

It is uses the Freelancer template from  [StartBootstrap](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-freelancer/) as starting point. The customizition is done with the resulting html and js files.
I do not like to use jade and this .pug file to make changes.
It uses plain JS for fetching Todoist. In the current State the Bearer Token is hard coded in custom.js.
So is also learning by doing and rapid development.
